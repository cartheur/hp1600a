Repository for research and development with the 1600A Logic State Analyzer.

## Background

_The Logic State Analyzer: A Viewing Port for the Data Domain_

A new logic state analyzer has expanded capabilities that speed the location of the sources of problems in digital systems and broaden the range of problems that can be resolved with this class of instrument.

The HP 1600A Logic State Analyzer is designed to aid in the analyses of digital system which depend on sequences of logic states to control their operation. The 1600A provides a functional display of `one`s and `zero`s in a tabular format of logic states with up to 16 variables in a digital system -- up to 32 variables may be displayed when a Model [1607A](https://github.com/cartheur/hp1607a) Logic State Analyzer is used with the 1600A in `bus` mode.

Here is a tabular-format sample of the data flowing through the _ideal_ algorithm:
